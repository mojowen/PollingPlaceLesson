## [Let's Build Where's Your Fucking Polling Place](http://yourfuckingpollingplace.com/)

Yay

## Get Started

One you've cloned the repo - run a simple http server to get `index.html`.

````shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
````

This serves a simple webpage with a form that retrieves data from [Google's Civic Information Project](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/).

## Key Concepts

 * AJAX requests: or how to get new data into someone's browser without reloading the page
 * What's an API and how do you use it
 * Event binding in javascript

## Going Further

There are several complex concepts at work in this demonstration that are hidden thanks to modern tools (and laziness).

 * Binding events at Document Ready
 * JSONP, AJAX, and handling Cross Origin Requests
 * Keeping Secrets from Git
 * Manipulating the DOM: jQuery vs Templates
